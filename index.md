## About Me

<small>Here is **Zhijie Yi (易至捷)**.

<small>I'm a second-year graduate student from [<u>Beijing Normal University</u>](https://www.bnu.edu.cn/). My research interests include Human-Computer Interaction, AI-assisted programming and design, Computer-Supported cooperative work, creative programming tools, AI for education, and user-centered design. I am currently working as an intern at the [<u>Institute for AI Industry Research, Tsinghua University</u>](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm).  

<small>I have two years of work experience in the industry. I possess both design and programming skills, excelling in leveraging programming to create creative tools for designers and the public. Proficient in qualitative research methods, I am particularly passionate about usability in human-computer interaction. My focus is on integrating design and programming expertise to develop innovative, highly usable tools that enhance user experiences.

## Research Interests

- Human-Computer Interaction
- AI-assisted programming and design
- Computer-Supported cooperative work
- Human-Centered AI
- AI for education
- Participatory design, Human-Centered design, Accessible design

My current research focus is on how to enable the public to better collaborate with intelligent systems and develop more human-centered algorithms and designs.  

**I am interested in three overarching questions:**  
- How to make LLM better help people design and program, and assist in design and programming education?
- How to improve information asymmetry in the interaction between humans and intelligent systems?
- How to lower the threshold for using intelligent systems and make them accessible to more people?
