## About Me

<small>Here is **Zhijie Yi (易至捷)**.

<small>I'm a second-year graduate student from [<u>Beijing Normal University</u>](https://www.bnu.edu.cn/). My research interests include creativity tools, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer-Supported cooperative work, Accessible design, Participatory design, Creative collaboration tools, and education. I am currently working as an intern at the [<u>Institute for AI Industry Research, Tsinghua University</u>](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm).  

<small>I have two years of industry experience and I possess a unique blend of design and programming expertise, enabling me to create innovative tools that enhance creative processes and foster public engagement in creation. My proficiency in qualitative research methods underpins a deep commitment to optimizing user experience within human-machine collaboration. Driven by a passion for empowering underserved communities, I am dedicated to developing accessible and user-friendly tools that address their specific challenges. By integrating design and programming knowledge, I strive to build solutions that are not only functional but also inclusive, ensuring they cater to a wide range of needs and preferences. Currently, I am exploring the application and value of AI in this area.
