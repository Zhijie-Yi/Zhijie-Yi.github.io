## About Me

<small>Here is **Zhijie Yi (易至捷)**.

<small>I'm a second-year graduate student from [<u>Beijing Normal University</u>](https://www.bnu.edu.cn/). My research interests include Human-Computer Interaction, Computer-Supported cooperative work, Accessible design, user-centered design, Creative collaboration tools, and education. I am currently working as an intern at the [<u>Institute for AI Industry Research, Tsinghua University</u>](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm).  

<small>I bring two years of industry experience in interaction design, combining design and programming skills to enhance design processes and develop innovative tools for designers and the broader public. Additionally, I have a solid foundation in qualitative research methods, with a keen interest in usability aspects of human-computer interaction. My ambition centers on merging design and programming knowledge to create accessible, user-friendly tools that inspire wider participation in design and creative endeavors. Currently, I am exploring the application and value of AI in this area.

## Research Interests

- Human-Computer Interaction
- AI-assisted programming and design
- Computer-Supported cooperative work
- Human-Centered AI
- AI for education
- Participatory design, Human-Centered design, Accessible design

My current research focuses on how to enable the public to better collaborate with intelligent systems, developing human-centered algorithms and designs through in-depth user research.  
<br>
**I am interested in three overarching questions:**  

- How to make LLM better help people design and program, and assist in design and programming education?
- How to improve information asymmetry in the interaction between humans and intelligent systems?
- How to lower the threshold for using intelligent systems and make them accessible to more people?
