## About Me

<small>Here is **Zhijie Yi (易至捷)**.

<small>I'm a second-year graduate student from [<u>Beijing Normal University</u>](https://www.bnu.edu.cn/). My research interests include creativity tools, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer-Supported cooperative work, Accessible design, Participatory design, Creative collaboration tools, and education. I am currently working as an intern at the [<u>Institute for AI Industry Research, Tsinghua University</u>](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm).  

<small>I have two years of industry experience and I possess skills in both design and programming, specializing in developing tools that enrich the creative process and foster public engagement in creative endeavors. My expertise extends to qualitative research methods, with a keen interest in exploring user experiences within human-machine collaborations. Driven by a passion for supporting underserved communities, I am dedicated to designing and developing tools tailored to address their unique challenges. My focus lies in seamlessly integrating design and programming knowledge to craft accessible and user-friendly tools. Currently, I am exploring the application and value of AI in this area.
