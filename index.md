## About Me

<small>Here is **Zhijie Yi (易至捷)**.

<small>I'm a third-year graduate student from [__Beijing Normal University__](https://www.bnu.edu.cn/). My research interests include human factors engineering, human-computer interaction, and computer-supported collaborative work. I am about to pursue a PhD in Intelligent Transportation at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou). I have worked as a research assistant at [__Institute for AI Industry Research, Tsinghua University__](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm) and [__HIS Lab of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)__](https://personal.hkust-gz.edu.cn/hedengbo/index.html).  

<small>I have extensive experience in experimental design and strong data analysis skills. My expertise extends to mixed research methods of qualitative and quantitative research. Currently, I have a strong interest in the field of transportation and autonomous driving, and my research revolves around state monitoring and behavior modeling of drivers (or other traffic participants) through multimodal data. I am exploring how to predict driver status through data and models to design safer autonomous driving systems (feedback and takeover).

## Research Interests

- Driver state monitoring and behavior modeling
- Interaction between vulnerable road users and autonomous electric vehicles
- External human-machine interfaces for autonomous vehicles
- Control tower operator interfaces for fleets of autonomous vehicles

My current research focuses on driving safety and trust in autonomous driving.
<br>
**I am interested in three overarching questions, which may evolve incrementally or in parallel:**  

- How to predict the fatigue state of drivers after a long time through physiological data?
- How to use data and models to develop better autonomous driving systems to improve takeover capabilities? 
- How to improve the interpretability of autonomous driving systems to increase the trust of various traffic participants?
