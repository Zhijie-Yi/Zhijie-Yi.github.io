## About Me

<font size=3>Here is **Zhijie Yi (易至捷)**.</font> 

<font size=3>I'm a second-year graduate student from [Beijing Normal University](https://www.bnu.edu.cn/). My research interests include Human-Computer Interaction, AI-assisted programming and design, Computer-Supported cooperative work, creative programming tools, AI for education, and user-centered design. I am currently working as an intern at the [Institute for AI Industry Research, Tsinghua University](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm).   

I have two years of work experience in the industry. I possess both design and programming skills, excelling in leveraging programming to create creative tools for designers and the public. Proficient in qualitative research methods, I am particularly passionate about usability in human-computer interaction. My focus is on integrating design and programming expertise to develop innovative, highly usable tools that enhance user experiences. 

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please email me at - *<font color='blue'>yzj[at]mail[dot]bnu[dot]edu[dot]cn</font>*</font>
